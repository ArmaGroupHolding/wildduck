# HTTP API

Wild Duck Mail Server is a scalable IMAP / POP3 server that natively exposes internal data through an HTTP API.

This API is not meant to be used by end users but your application.

## API Usage Info

### Authentication

This API should be used by your application and not by the end users directly, so normally it should probably be hidden behind a firewall.

To add another layer of protection the API can be set to require an access token. The token value can be set in configuration file "api.accessToken". If the value is set, then all requests against the API must include a query argument *accessToken* with the same value as in the configuration file.

```
curl "http://localhost:8080/users?query=testuser01&accessToken=secrettoken"
```

### Responses

All successful responses look like the following:

```
{
  "success": true,
  other response specific fields
}
```

All failed responses look like the following:

```json
{
  "error": "Some error message"
}
```

### Paging

For paging lists longer than allowed limit, Wild Duck API returns URLs for `next` and `previous` pages. When paging do not change these URLs yourself. If query arguments are changed then the results might be unreliable.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "total": 200,
  "page": 2,
  "results": ["a list of results"],
  "previousCursor": "abcdef12344",
  "nextCursor": "abcdef12377"
}
```

## Users

User accounts

### Search and list users

#### GET /users

Returns data about existing users

**Parameters**

- **query** is an optional string to filter username (partial match), by default all users are listed
- **limit** is an optional number to limit listing length, defaults to 20

**Example**

```
curl "http://localhost:8080/users?query=testuser01"
```

Response for a successful operation:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "query": "testuser01",
  "total": 1,
  "page": 1,
  "previousCursor": false,
  "nextCursor": false,
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "5970860fcdb513ce633407a1",
      "username": "testuser01",
      "address": "testuser01@example.com",
      "quota": {
        "allowed": 1073741824,
        "used": 0
      },
      "disabled": false
    }
  ]
}
```

### Get one user

#### GET /users/{user}

Returns data about a specific user

**Parameters**

- **user** is the ID of the user

**Example**

```
curl "http://localhost:8080/users/5970860fcdb513ce633407a1"
```

  "retention": false,
  "limits": {
    "quota": {
      "allowed": 1073741824,
      "used": 0
    },
    "recipients": {
      "allowed": 2000,
      "used": 0,
      "ttl": false
    },
    "forwards": {

      "used": 0,
      "ttl": false
    }
  },
  "activated": true,

```

Response for a successful operation:

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

### Reset user password

#### POST /users/{user}/password/reset

## 2FA

Wild Duck supports TOTP based 2FA. If 2FA is enabled then users are requested to enter authentication token after successful login. Also, with 2FA enabled, master password can not be used in IMAP, POP3 or SMTP. The user must create an [Application Specific Password](#application-specific-passwords) with a correct scope for email clients using these protocols.

2FA checks do not happen magically, your application must be 2FA aware:

1. Authenticate user with the [/authenticate](#authenticate-an-user) call
2. If authentication result includes `requirePasswordChange:true` then force user to change their password
3. If authentication result includes `require2fa:false` then do nothing, the user is now authenticated. Otherwise continue with Step 4.
4. Request TOTP token from the user before allowing to perform other actions
5. Check the token with [/user/{user}/2fa?token=123456](#check-2fa)
6. If token verification succeeds then user is authenticated

### Setup 2FA

#### POST /users/{user}/2fa

This call prepares the user to support 2FA tokens. If 2FA is already enabled then this call fails.

**Parameters**

- **user** (required) is the ID of the user
- **issuer** is the name to be shown in the Authenticator App
- **fresh** is a boolean. If true then generates a new seed even if an old one already exists
- **ip** is the IP address the request was made from

**Response fields**

- **success** should be `true`
- **qrcode** is the data url for the 2FA QR-code. The user must scan the code and return the token with a PUT call

**Example**

```
curl -XPOST "http://localhost:8080/users/5971da1754cfdc7f0983b2ec/2fa" -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{
  "issuer": "testikas",
  "ip": "192.168.10.10"
}'
```

Response for a successful operation:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "qrcode": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSU..."
}
```

### Verify 2FA

#### PUT /users/{user}/2fa

Once 2FA QR code is generated the user must return the token with this call. Once the token is successfully provided then 2FA is enabled for the account.

**Parameters**

- **user** (required) is the ID of the user
- **token** is the 2FA token generated from the QR code
- **ip** is the IP address the request was made from

**Response fields**

- **success** should be `true`

**Example**

```
curl -XPUT "http://localhost:8080/users/5971da1754cfdc7f0983b2ec/2fa" -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{
  "token": "455912",
  "ip": "192.168.10.10"
}'
```

Response for a successful operation:

```json
{
  "success": true
}

Response for a successful operation:

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

### Check 2FA

#### GET /users/{user}/2fa

```

Response for a successful operation:

```json
{
  "success": true

### Add a new Application Specific Password

#### POST /users/{user}/asps

Creates a new Application Specific Password for an existing user, returns the ID upon success.

**Parameters**

- **user** (required) is the ID of the user
- **description** (required) is the name or description for the new Application Specific Password
- **scopes** is an array (or a comma separated string) of scopes this password is valid for. Valid scopes are "imap", "pop3", "smtp". Special scope "*" (also the default) is valid for all ASP supported scopes (this does not include "master")
- **generateMobileconfig** is a boolean. If true, then the result includes a base64 formatted profile file to autoconfigure OSX and iOS mail clients
- **ip** is the IP address the request was made from

**Example**

```
curl -XPOST "http://localhost:8080/users/5971da1754cfdc7f0983b2ec/asps" -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{
  "description": "Mac OSX Mail Client",
  "scopes": ["*"],
  "ip": "192.168.10.10"
}'
```

Response for a successful operation:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "id": "59762d2f9c035be17bbb1fde",
  "password": "mjxlzydlusadfynn"
}
```

Or with the profile file:

```
curl -XPOST "http://localhost:8080/users/5971da1754cfdc7f0983b2ec/asps" -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{
    "description": "Mac OSX Mail Client",
    "scopes": ["imap", "smtp"],
    "generateMobileconfig": true
    "ip": "192.168.10.10"
}'
```

and the result with the profile file:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "id": "59773be3a7bc855155286d91",
  "password": "slrfwaavyzmatgxf",
  "mobileconfig": "MIIO8gYJKoZIhvcNAQcCo..."
}
```

Resulting password should be shown to the client. This password is shown only once so if the user forgets it then the APS should be deleted and replaced with a new one. Application Specific Password can include spaces, so using "slrf waav yzma tgxf" is the same as "slrfwaavyzmatgxf".

Profile file should be sent to the client with Content-Type value of `application/x-apple-aspen-config`.

```javascript
res.set('Content-Description', 'Mail App Configuration Profile');
res.set('Content-Type', 'application/x-apple-aspen-config');
res.set('Content-Disposition', 'attachment; filename="profile.mobileconfig"');
res.send(Buffer.from(asp.mobileconfig, 'base64'));
```

## Quota

### Recalculate user quota

Recalculates used storage for an user. Use this when it seems that quota counters for an user do not match with reality.

**Example**

```
curl -XPOST "http://localhost:8080/users/59467f27535f8f0f067ba8e6/quota/reset" -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{}'
```

```json

Be aware though that this method is not atomic and should be done only if quota counters are way off.

## Updates

Get user related events as an Event Source stream

### Stream update events

#### GET /users/{user}/updates

Streams changes in user account as EventSource stream

**Parameters**

- **user** (required) is the ID of the user

**Example**

```
curl "http://localhost:8080/users/59467f27535f8f0f067ba8e6/updates"
```

Response stream:

```
data: {"command":"EXISTS", "message":"596e0703f0bdd512aeac3600", "mailbox":"596c9c37ef2213165daadc65",...}
id: 596e0703f0bdd512aeac3605

data: {"command":"CREATE","mailbox":"596e09853f845a14f3620b5c","name":"My Mail",...}
id: 596e09853f845a14f3620b5d
```

First entry in the event stream indicates that a message with id `596e0703f0bdd512aeac3600` was added to mailbox `596c9c37ef2213165daadc65`, second entry indicates that a new mailbox called *"My Mail"* with id `596e09853f845a14f3620b5c` was created.

Be aware though that this connection needs to be properly closed if you do not want to end up with memory leaks.

You can see a demo of catching user events when navigating to http://localhost:8080/public/ (assuming localhost:8080 is your API host).
